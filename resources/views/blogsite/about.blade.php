      <p>SEO for everyone also means we share our knowledge with everyone. The Yoast SEO Academy has an impressive catalog of
         courses that cover a wide range of topics. Among other things, we teach people how to do keyword research and to use
          structured data to get rich results. So far, the academy has helped over 300,000 people (and counting) master SEO and 
          improve their websites. And, there is also our blog: it’s the place where we share SEO tips, news, and best practices.
           Nearly a million users visit our website every month!?</p>

      <p>At Yoast, we are strongly committed to making the web better. We work together with other companies (Google/ Microsoft)
         to improve the web, for instance by contributing to the schema.org project. And, as open source fanboys and girls, we 
         are dedicated to WordPress as well! Together with the WordPress community, we can help it maintain its position as the
          fastest-growing CMS!</p>
